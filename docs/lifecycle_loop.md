## Overview

Modern event-driven architectures in trading systems typically involve two key components:

1. **Lifecycle Loop**: Manages the application's runtime lifecycle
2. **Event Bus**: Coordinates communication between components

This document explores how these components work together to create efficient trading systems.

## The Lifecycle Loop

The lifecycle loop is responsible for:

- Starting and initializing system components
- Maintaining connections and resources
- Handling graceful shutdowns
- Monitoring system health

### Lifecycle Loop Implementation

```go
func runTradingSystem() {
    // Initialize components
    initialize_components()
    
    // Start websocket connections
    start_websocket_connections()
    
    try {
        // Minimal event loop - just keeps the program running
        while running {
            // Check for system events (shutdown signals, etc.)
            check_system_events()
            
            // Sleep to avoid consuming CPU
            time.sleep(0.1)
        }
    } catch KeyboardInterrupt {
        printf("Shutting down...")
    } finally {
        // Clean shutdown
        close_websocket_connections()
        shutdown_components()
    }
}
```

The lifecycle loop isn't processing every market data event or trade signal - it's maintaining the environment where those events can be processed through callbacks and event bus.

## The Event Bus

The event bus facilitates communication between components by:

- Providing a central messaging system
- Decoupling event producers from consumers
- Ensuring events are delivered to appropriate handlers
- Supporting different event types and priorities

### Event Bus Implementation

```go
type EventBus struct {
    handlers map[EventType][]EventHandler
    eventCounts map[EventType]int
}

func (bus *EventBus) Register(eventType EventType, handler EventHandler) {
    if _, exists := bus.handlers[eventType]; !exists {
        bus.handlers[eventType] = []EventHandler{}
        bus.eventCounts[eventType] = 0
    }
    bus.handlers[eventType] = append(bus.handlers[eventType], handler)
}

func (bus *EventBus) Emit(event Event) {
    // Track event counts
    if _, exists := bus.eventCounts[event.Type]; exists {
        bus.eventCounts[event.Type]++
    } else {
        bus.eventCounts[event.Type] = 1
    }
    
    // Process through handlers
    if handlers, exists := bus.handlers[event.Type]; exists {
        for _, handler := range handlers {
            handler(event)
        }
    }
}
```

## Real-Time Data Flow Pattern

A complete event-driven trading system typically follows this pattern:

1. **Data Sources** (WebSockets, APIs) emit events to the Event Bus
2. **Event Handlers** process specific event types
3. **Strategies** subscribe to relevant events and generate signals
4. **Execution Engine** converts signals to orders
5. **Position Manager** tracks and manages trading positions

### WebSocket Event Handling Example

```go
func setupWebSocketHandlers(client WebSocketClient, eventBus EventBus) {
    client.OnMessage(func(message []byte) {
        // Parse message
        marketData := parseMarketData(message)
        
        // Create and emit bar event
        barEvent := BarEvent{
            Symbol: marketData.Symbol,
            Open: marketData.Open,
            High: marketData.High,
            Low: marketData.Low,
            Close: marketData.Close,
            Volume: marketData.Volume,
            Timestamp: marketData.Timestamp,
        }
        
        eventBus.Emit(Event{Type: BAR_EVENT, Data: barEvent})
    })
}
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Reactive Design**: The system responds immediately to market events
2. **Better Resource Utilization**: No CPU wasted on polling for events
3. **Clean Separation of Concerns**: Components only process relevant events
4. **Scalability**: Add new data sources or event types without modifying core
5. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mock events

## Comparison to Traditional Approaches

Unlike traditional central event loop designs, this approach:

- Minimizes the loop's responsibilities (lifecycle only, not event processing)
- Uses direct callbacks for event handling rather than polling
- Leverages asynchronous I/O for better performance
- Provides cleaner code organization with explicit event flow

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Thread Safety**: Ensure the event bus is thread-safe if accessed from multiple threads
2. **Backpressure Handling**: Plan for handling events arriving faster than they can be processed
3. **Error Isolation**: Errors in event handlers shouldn't crash data connections
4. **Monitoring**: Track event counts and processing times to identify bottlenecks

## Conclusion

The combination of a minimal lifecycle loop with an event-driven architecture enables trading systems to efficiently handle high-frequency data while maintaining clean code organization and separation of concerns. This pattern is especially well-suited for financial markets where responding quickly to events is critical.
