# Strategy Components Module - Next Steps

## Implementation Priorities

### 1. Base Component Classes
- Implement `ComponentBase` abstract class with common functionality
- Create `IndicatorBase`, `FeatureBase`, and `RuleBase` classes
- Ensure proper integration with the event system
- Implement registration with the component registry
- Add parameter validation and management

### 2. Basic Indicators
- Implement `SimpleMovingAverage` as the first indicator
- Add `ExponentialMovingAverage` as a more responsive alternative
- Implement `BollingerBands` for volatility measurement
- Create `RSI` (Relative Strength Index) for momentum measurement
- Implement `MACD` (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Ensure all indicators handle edge cases (insufficient data, etc.)

### 3. Technical Features
- Create `PriceFeatures` for open/high/low/close transformations
- Implement `VolumePriceFeatures` for volume-weighted metrics
- Add `VolatilityFeatures` for standard deviation and variance
- Implement `TrendFeatures` for trend detection and measurement
- Create `PatternFeatures` for common chart patterns

### 4. Trading Rules
- Implement `CrossoverRule` for moving average crossovers
- Create `ThresholdRule` for indicator threshold signals
- Add `PatternRule` for chart pattern detection
- Implement `CompositeRule` for combining multiple rules
- Create `FilteredRule` for rules with market condition filters

### 5. Factory and Registry
- Finalize the component registry implementation
- Create factory methods for each component type
- Implement component serialization/deserialization
- Add component configuration loading from files
- Create standard component bundles for common strategies

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Maintain consistent interfaces across all components
- Ensure components are stateless where possible
- Use composition over inheritance for complex components
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Follow consistent naming conventions

### Testing Approach
- Create unit tests for each individual component
- Add integration tests for component combinations
- Implement benchmark tests for performance-critical indicators
- Create visualization tests for indicator validation
- Use property-based testing for rule combinations

### Documentation Requirements
- Add detailed docstrings with parameters and return values
- Include usage examples for each component
- Document performance characteristics and computation complexity
- Add references to academic papers where relevant
- Create a component catalog with visual examples

## Integration Strategy

### Data Module Integration
- Ensure all indicators can work with the data formats provided
- Create adapters for different data sources if needed
- Implement efficient data access patterns for indicators
- Add caching for computationally expensive indicators
- Ensure proper error propagation from data to indicators

### Event System Integration
- Implement proper event handling for signal generation
- Ensure components emit and receive appropriate events
- Create event-based testing utilities
- Implement event logging for component debugging
- Add event filtering for strategy-specific processing

### Strategy Module Preparation
- Design interfaces for strategy composition
- Create building blocks for common strategy types
- Implement parameter optimization interfaces
- Add strategy performance metrics
- Prepare for strategy backtest integration
